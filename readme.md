# Cosplayer Workshop

My first [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site. 

My daughter uses my workshop to build her costumes and props, and there are a lot of interesting tools there that make her work easier. I'm starting this site to:

1. Learn Elevety
2. Document some of the cool tools I have that cosplayers can use to simplify their work

This site is a work in progress, but should be fun putting together.
