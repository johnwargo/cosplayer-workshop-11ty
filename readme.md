# Cosplayer Workshop

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6be85c2c-8db7-4113-9fa1-7d3c8d4852f6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cosplayer-workshop/deploys)

My first [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site. I'm building this using [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/)'s [A Guide to Building a Blog in Eleventy](https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html)

My daughter uses my workshop to build her costumes and props, and there are a lot of interesting tools there that make her work easier. I'm starting this site to:

1. Learn Eleventy
2. Document some of the cool tools I have that Cosplayers (people who Cosplay) can use to simplify their work

## Tasks

* [ ] Add buy me a Coffee
* [ ] Add Google Analytics
* [ ] Add Search

This site is a work in progress, but should be fun putting together.
