# Cosplayer Workshop

My first [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site. I'm building this using [Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com/)'s [A Guide to Building a Blog in Eleventy](https://www.raymondcamden.com/2022/01/19/a-guide-to-building-a-blog-in-eleventy)

My daughter uses my workshop to build her costumes and props, and there are a lot of interesting tools there that make her work easier. I'm starting this site to:

1. Learn Elevety
2. Document some of the cool tools I have that cosplayers can use to simplify their work

This site is a work in progress, but should be fun putting together.
