    <p>My daughter took up Cosplay back in 2017, she offered to give me the exact date, but that's not really important here. She started by watching Anime, then read a bunch of Manga, and before long she was hooked.</p>
    <p>At the beginning, she scoured Goodwill for clothes she could cut up and use different ways. We bought her a sewing machine for Christmas and she started sewing away. Eventually she started asking for us to buy her the raw materials she needed for her costumes but that quickly became us ordering a wide variety of costumes from Amazon, all shipped from far away in China.</p>
    <p>With all of that came the need to build props for her costumes. </p>
