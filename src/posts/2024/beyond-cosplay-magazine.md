I don't know exactly how this came about, but Liz (represented for some reason as Lizz in the magazine) was recently interviewed by a student working on a digital magazine on Cosplay called [Beyond Cosplay Magazine](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/335829250/46-47/){target="_blank"}. They recently shared the magazine and it's amazing. 

In the magazine, is a photo of Liz in one of her most amazing costumes and the article mentioning her starts with this photo:

It's absolutely amazing what Liz did with that costume, hand crafting all the bones, sewing all the parts, it just fits her perfectly and is stunning to look at. I hope someday I can get her to write some articles here highlighting how she made this particular costume.
