This is my daughter Lizzy and me, from way back in 2005. She liked me more back then because I didn’t hound her to do the dishes or pick up her clothes. Aaah, those were different days back then.

This is Lizzy now; she’s an accomplished Cosplayer and goes by Lizzy Space Wizard (or just Space Wizard, I can never remember). See what I mean?

I share a workshop with her now; I use the shop for woodworking and electronics projects and she uses it for her Cosplay costumes and props.
