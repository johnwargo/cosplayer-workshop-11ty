This is my daughter Lizzy and me, from way back in 2005. She liked me a lot more back then because I didn’t hound her to do the dishes or pick up her clothes. Aaah, those were different days back then.

This is Lizzy now; she’s an accomplished Cosplayer and goes by [Space Wizard](https://www.instagram.com/itsspacewizard/). See what I mean about how accomplished she is?

I share a workshop with her now; I use the shop for woodworking and electronics projects and she uses it for her Cosplay costumes and props. I'll use this site to write about the tools I share with her to help her with her projects.
